---

## 2026-05-16 — Project initialized

**Started from:** New project setup via /new-project.

**Did:** Created repo, set up CLAUDE.md/DECISIONS.md/HANDOFF.md/PLAN.md/
FAILURES.md. Project brief exists in Downloads as reference.

**State:** Foundation in place. Ready for /clarify to scope the work.

**Next:** Run /clarify to reach 95% confidence on scope, then
/office-hours for Heavy-tier gate.

---

## 2026-05-16 21:00 — Planning complete (session wrap)

**Started from:** Fresh project scaffolding, no scope defined.

**Did:** Full Heavy-tier planning workflow: /clarify → /office-hours → /plan-ceo-review → /plan-eng-review → /ce:brainstorm → /ce:plan. Researched all 6 sibling Cinderhaven repos. Verified data granularity (97 deduction codes, full channel-specific rates). Produced requirements doc and 7-unit implementation plan.

**State:** Requirements doc at `docs/brainstorms/channel-profitability-narrative-requirements.md`. Implementation plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-16-001-feat-channel-profitability-narrative-plan.md`. Tech stack: Astro + React/D3 islands + Cloudflare Pages. No code exists yet.

**Next:** Run /ce:work. Start U1 (Astro scaffolding in this repo) and U2 (dbt mart in cinderhaven-data-platform) in parallel. U1 is self-contained. U2 requires cross-repo work.

---

## 2026-05-16 23:45

**What changed:** Completed U5+U6 — all seven narrative sections wired end-to-end with real data, interactive charts, and Economist-style prose.

**Why:** U5 proved the full pipeline (JSON → MDX → React → D3) with headline, revenue, and deductions sections. U6 completed the remaining four: fines, operational overhead, contribution margins, and capital allocation recommendations.

**State:** All 7 sections render with 4 interactive D3 charts, click-to-pin callout cards, contribution table, and 3 ranked allocation recommendations. DTC has worst margin (71.6%), club retailer highest deduction intensity (8.5%), label fines are $222K. U1–U6 complete. U7 (polish + deploy) remains.

**Next:** Start U7 — add Cinderhaven cold-start orientation paragraph, review responsive/print, test production build, deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

---

## 2026-05-17 00:15

**What changed:** Added quarterly trend section with TrendChart component (D3 multi-line chart) showing margin evolution over 5 quarters. Updated all time period language to Economist-style "in the year to March 2026".

**Why:** User requested time period clarity and trend-over-time visibility. CPG best practice: narratives fix the period in prose; trends show directionality as a separate chart. Key finding: Q1 2026 margin compression — Costco drops to 83.5%, Walmart to 89%, distributors drift down 4pts.

**State:** Narrative now 8 sections (added "trends" between operational and contribution). TrendChart renders retailer and distributor multi-line charts with click-to-pin. trends.json contains 5 quarters of contribution data exported from the dbt mart. All sections use consistent "year to March 2026" time period. Site builds and renders correctly. Deployed version at Cloudflare Pages is stale (pre-trends).

**Next:** Rebuild and redeploy to Cloudflare Pages, then push/merge worktree to main.

---

## 2026-05-17 00:30 — Session wrap

**What changed:** Redeployed to Cloudflare Pages with trend charts, pushed and merged to main. Note: Cinderhaven dataset is being improved with more realistic data derived from industry norms — figures in this analysis will shift when the updated dataset lands.

**Why:** Completing the deploy/merge cycle for the trends work. Dataset note recorded so next session knows the numbers are provisional.

**State:** All 8 narrative sections live at https://channels.lailarallc.com. Main branch up to date. U1–U7 implementation complete. /ce:review and /qa gates remain for Heavy tier. Dataset refresh pending from cinderhaven-data-platform.

**Next:** Run /ce:review (reviewer ensemble), then /qa for browser testing. After dataset refresh, re-export layers.json, channels.json, and trends.json, then update any hardcoded figures in prose.

---

## 2026-05-17 12:40

**What changed:** Data audit — fixed 4 factual errors in narrative prose. Erosion range (4%→8%), operational overhead formula (30min→5hrs to match $236K), DTC COGS multiplier (triple→nearly eight times), unclassified deductions ($277K third-largest→$339K largest).

**Why:** Cross-checked every hardcoded figure in MDX prose against channels.json and layers.json. Found four claims that didn't match the data. All other figures verified correct.

**State:** All narrative prose now reconciles with JSON data. Build succeeds. Site not yet redeployed with these fixes. Dataset refresh still pending from cinderhaven-data-platform — when it lands, re-run this audit.

**Next:** Redeploy to Cloudflare Pages, push/merge to main, then /wrap.

---

## 2026-05-17 14:00 — Session wrap

**Started from:** Data audit complete, dataset refresh pending. User requested full data re-export from database and fix all review findings.

**Did:** Connected to cinderhaven-db on Fly.io, extracted refreshed mart data (now has realistic COGS: 50-60% wholesale, 27% DTC). Regenerated all 3 JSON files via new `scripts/generate_json.py`. Rewrote all 8 narrative sections — story completely reversed (DTC now best margin at 73%, wholesale 21-34%). Fixed print.css bug, removed unused imports. Built, deployed, pushed, opened PR #1.

**State:** Site live at Cloudflare Pages with new data. PR #1 open against main. Build clean, all figures verified. **Known issue:** Analysis period includes future dates (data runs Jan 2024 – Dec 2026, today is May 2026). Narrative says "three-year analysis period" but should either filter to trailing 12 months or reframe language to "previous 12 months from today's date" / "last year through YTD."

**Next:** Fix analysis period — add date filter to mart query (trailing 12 months) and re-export, OR reframe narrative language. Then merge PR #1 to main. Then /ce:review and /qa for Heavy tier gates.

---

## 2026-05-17 16:30

**What changed:** Full 4-phase audit confirms data integrity; added dispute recovery insight from new fct_payments table.

**Why:** User concern that upstream DB changes (new rows/tables) might invalidate the analysis. Verified fiscal year revenue and deductions are byte-for-byte identical. New tables (fct_chargebacks, fct_payments, fct_shipments) serve sibling projects and don't affect this one. Discovery: fct_payments shows $359K recovered against $324K dispute overhead (10.7% net ROI) — incorporated into narrative.

**State:** All data verified correct against live DB. Meta tag fixed ($32M→removed). Operational section and allocation recommendation updated with recovery data. AUDIT.md documents full findings. Build passes. Not yet redeployed.

**Next:** Redeploy to Cloudflare Pages with updated narrative. Then /ce:review and /qa remain as Heavy tier gates per PLAN.md.

---

## 2026-05-17 17:00

**What changed:** Added prose-vs-data validation test (27 checks) and single-command data refresh script.

**Why:** Automated protection against data drift. test_prose_data.py catches hardcoded MDX claims that no longer match JSON; refresh_data.py pulls fresh fiscal-year data from cinderhaven-db, updates generate_json.py, regenerates JSON, and validates in one command.

**State:** Both scripts committed and passing. Prose validation confirms all 27 claims match data. Refresh script parses cleanly but requires flyctl auth to run end-to-end. Audit complete, recovery insight incorporated, all narrative updated. Not yet redeployed.

**Next:** Redeploy to Cloudflare Pages. Then /ce:review and /qa for Heavy tier gates.

---

## 2026-05-17 17:15

**What changed:** Completed /ce:review — 4-agent ensemble (correctness, maintainability, architecture, performance) found 16 issues, all fixed and merged.

**Why:** Heavy tier gate. Key fixes: deleted deprecated export_data.py, hardened refresh_data.py against partial writes, scoped D3 imports, extracted MarginTable component, fixed SSR hydration mismatch, added schema + recovery validation to test suite. Net -657 lines.

**State:** All review findings addressed (PR #3 merged). Build passes. Tests pass (30/30). Site not yet redeployed with review fixes. /ce:review gate complete.

**Next:** Run /qa (browser testing) — the final Heavy tier gate.

---

## 2026-05-17 17:30 — Session wrap

**What changed:** Completed /qa browser testing — all checks pass. Both Heavy tier gates (/ce:review + /qa) done.

**Why:** Final gate for Heavy tier workflow. Verified: zero console errors, correct content structure (7 sections, 3 tables, 14 chart islands), design system compliance (fonts, colors, type scale), mobile responsive (no overflow), print stylesheet applied. Chart interaction untestable in headless (IntersectionObserver limitation) but build output confirms correct props.

**State:** All PLAN.md tasks complete. Build passes. Tests pass (30/30). PRs #2–#4 merged to main. Site redeployed to Cloudflare Pages. Arc marked complete in PLAN.md.

**Next:** Optional /ce:compound to extract learnings. Otherwise this arc is done — project is in maintenance mode.

---

## 2026-05-20 12:15

**What changed:** Fixed all color tokens across 7 files to match Lailara Design System v2. Every color was wrong; typography, layout, and interaction patterns were already correct.

**Why:** Audit against the design system revealed ad-hoc hex values throughout — canvas, text, gridlines, navy accent (wrong hue entirely), red, and the full teal palette all diverged from the spec. Chicago blue replaced steel blue; Hong Kong HK-5–HK-85 replaced custom teals.

**State:** All colors now match LAILARA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md. Files changed: global.css, chartUtils.ts, ChannelChart.tsx, TrendChart.tsx, MarginTable.tsx, 08-allocation.mdx, print.css. Build passes, zero console errors, verified via preview_inspect. Not yet redeployed.

**Next:** Redeploy to Cloudflare Pages with corrected colors.

---

## 2026-05-20 12:25 — Session wrap

**What changed:** Redeployed to Cloudflare Pages with corrected design system colors. Build clean, zero errors.

**Why:** Previous deploy had ad-hoc colors; now matches Lailara Design System v2.

**State:** Site live at https://channels.lailarallc.com with correct colors. All PLAN.md tasks complete. Main arc done. `/ce:compound` (extract learnings) is the only remaining Heavy-tier step. No failing tests, no broken builds.

**Next:** Run `/ce:compound` to extract learnings from this project. Otherwise project is in maintenance mode.

---

## 2026-05-22 — Data refresh + compound + reconciliation

**What changed:** Full data refresh from Postgres (17x revenue scale-up), narrative rewrite, compound learning doc, and SSOT reconciliation.

**Did:**
- Refreshed all snapshot constants in `generate_json.py` from live Postgres queries (revenue, COGS, deductions, disputes, quarterly data)
- Rewrote all 8 MDX narrative files — story reversed: distributors now best margin (~90%), DTC middle (83%), retailers lowest (80–83%)
- Updated all 34 test assertions in `test_prose_data.py` — all pass
- Ran `/ce:compound` — inaugural learning doc at `docs/solutions/best-practices/data-narrative-consistency-validation-2026-05-22.md`
- Verified full reconciliation: every snapshot constant matches Postgres exactly
- Updated PLAN.md goal with correct post-refresh numbers
- Redeployed to Cloudflare Pages

**State:** Site live with refreshed data. All tests pass (34/34). All snapshot constants reconciled with Postgres SSOT. 4 commits pushed to origin. `/ce:compound` complete. Project in maintenance mode.

**Next:** Run `/improve` for project health check. Otherwise maintenance mode.

---

## 2026-05-22 — /improve pass (12 findings, all fixed)

**What changed:** Full /improve audit (3 automated reviewers + manual) found 12 issues across 3 priority levels. All 12 fixed and redeployed.

**Did:**
- CRITICAL: Fixed DTC channel_type case mismatch (`"dtc"` → `"DTC"`) — live site was showing empty DTC charts across 5 sections
- CRITICAL: Rewrote `refresh_data.py` — was referencing non-existent tables (`fct_orders`, `fct_deductions`) and wrong columns. Now uses correct schema (`fct_retailer_orders`, `fct_distributor_orders`, `fct_dtc_orders`, `fct_retailer_deductions`, `fct_distributor_deductions`) and covers both retailers and distributors
- CRITICAL: Rewrote `verify_math.py` — was using hardcoded stale values with wrong channel indices. Now derives all values from JSON (160+ checks)
- CRITICAL: Rewrote `verify_roi.py` — was completely stale. Now derives from JSON
- IMPORTANT: Rewrote README.md with correct revenue ($76.8M), stack, setup, pipeline, and validation docs
- IMPORTANT: Filled in CLAUDE.md Stack section (was "TBD"), corrected revenue figure
- IMPORTANT: Populated DECISIONS.md with 4 documented decisions (quarterly margin formula, Postgres SSOT, output format, voice)
- IMPORTANT: `npm audit fix` resolved ws vulnerability (3 of 5 vulns); astro XSS deferred (breaking major version change, no user input on static site)
- NICE TO HAVE: Expanded .gitignore (`.wrangler/`, `*.sqlite`, credentials, backups)
- NICE TO HAVE: Added security headers via `public/_headers` (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- NICE TO HAVE: Marked AUDIT.md as historical with note about data refresh
- Data review confirmed: all 120 calculation checks pass, trends/fiscal ~0.3% rounding gap is expected (different aggregation paths)

**State:** Site redeployed with DTC fix and security headers. Build passes. All tests pass (34/34 prose, 160+ math checks). `/improve` logged in PLAN.md Improvement History. Next review due 2026-06-22.

**Next:** Maintenance mode. No open tasks. Next /improve audit due 2026-06-22.

## 2026-06-19 — Post-COGS data reconciliation (session wrap)

**Started from:** Phase 5 change report flagged "9–20% margin variance" as unresolvable. COGS fix had left stale figures across prose and tests.

**Did:** Traced 9–20% figure to old headline prose. Rewrote 06-trends.mdx (narrative direction was inverted). Fixed 28 test assertions + 1 canonical regression test → 11/11 passing. Applied 18 number swaps across 03-deductions, 04-fines, 05-operational, 08-allocation. Fixed 08-allocation Costco margin (79.6%→46.3%) and trade rate (1.1%→1.5%). Scaffolded review.yaml, ran first UI review. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

**State:** 11/11 tests passing. All prose figures match pipeline JSON. Site deployed with correct figures. review.yaml in place for future UI reviews.

**Next:** Maintenance mode. PLAN.md Goal section has stale margin figures (cosmetic — arc is complete). Next /improve audit due 2026-06-22 (3 days).

---

## 2026-06-19 — Redesign clarify + maintenance page (session wrap)

**Started from:** User pasted full redesign brainstorm spec. Ran /clarify interview.

**Did:**
- Completed /clarify interview (11 questions). Key decisions: rule-based prose engine (not LLM), all 7 chart types in single release, 3-level drill-down with full interpretive prose at each level, custom date range filtering, no mobile/print, in-place content transitions with breadcrumbs.
- Updated PLAN.md with new arc (old arc archived to history).
- Deployed maintenance page to channels.lailarallc.com — current site is dark. Maintenance page uses Lailara design system (correct tokens, fonts, layout).
- Backed up original index.astro as `index.astro.bak`.
- Scouted Postgres quarterly data granularity. Finding: all 5 waterfall layers have date columns — fines and overhead are in the same deduction tables as trade deductions. The v1 "quarterly lags" was a modeling choice, not a data limitation. COGS uses static ratios (apply to quarterly revenue).
- DB password auth failed during scouting — logged in FAILURES.md. Findings derived from existing query patterns, not live query.

**State:** Maintenance page live at channels.lailarallc.com. PLAN.md has full redesign scope. /clarify complete. Critical data dependency resolved (all layers have quarterly grain). DB auth needs credential reset before next data refresh.

**Next:** Fix DB auth (credential reset on Fly.io). Then continue Heavy-tier workflow: /office-hours → /plan-ceo-review → /plan-eng-review → /ce:brainstorm → /ce:plan → /ce:work.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Single-quarter chart fix + compound doc (session wrap)

**Started from:** Previous session completed full redesign (§1–§7), deployed, wrapped. Unpushed commits and no tag.

**Did:** Pushed to origin and tagged `v2.0-redesign`. Fixed single-quarter Margin Evolution chart bug (scalePoint mapped lone domain value to x=0, d3Line produced degenerate path). Ran `/ce-compound` full with session history — produced solution doc. Compound reviewers caught two bonus issues: dead `singleQuarter` ternary in `lineFn` (removed) and x-axis label misalignment in single-quarter view (fixed). Confirmed design system documents dark card tokens.

**State:** Main branch pushed with 3 new commits. Tag `v2.0-redesign` on origin. Live site has initial dot fix deployed but not the label alignment fix (Wrangler auth failed on second deploy — needs manual re-deploy). TrendChart.tsx flagged as having the same latent scalePoint bug (task spawned).

**Next:** Re-deploy to Cloudflare Pages with label alignment fix. Apply single-quarter guard to TrendChart.tsx. Run `/ce:review` and `/qa` for Heavy tier gates. `/improve` overdue (due 2026-06-22).

---

## 2026-06-20 — UI polish + dispute data pipeline fix (session wrap)

**Started from:** Redesign deployed. User reported iterative UI issues and $0 dispute overhead bug.

**Did:**
- Fixed MarginEvolutionChart: 2% y-axis tick intervals, label collision avoidance, click-to-isolate "Show all" exit button
- Added inline median row to MarginTable at correct sorted position (works for all sort columns)
- Reverted DTC color to Singapore-55 (#ee8a2a)
- Iterated segment card backgrounds (Chicago-95 → London-95 → white + 4px colored left border with box-shadow hover)
- **Key fix:** Diagnosed and fixed $0 dispute overhead in Capital Allocation cards. Root cause: `synthesizeFromTrends()` hardcoded `disputes_filed: 0` and mapped layers 2/3/4 all to `contribution`. Fix: added `fines`, `overhead`, `disputes_filed` fields to `generate_json.py` trends output; updated `TrendChannel` interface and `synthesizeFromTrends()` to build distinct layers (layer 2 = contribution + fines, layer 3 = contribution, layer 4 = contribution - overhead). Fines split from deductions using structural ratio; overhead/disputes prorated by revenue share.
- Updated scatter chart footnote from hardcoded "Full range, annual data" to dynamic `periodLabel`
- Deployed both otif-blind-spot and channel-profitability-analysis via OAuth fallback (API token was stale)
- User set new CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN via `setx` — will take effect next session

**State:** Site live at channels.lailarallc.com. Capital Allocation cards now show real dispute figures for all time filters (FY2026: $148K overhead, ~513 national mass retailer disputes; Full Range: $186K, ~637). All changes committed and pushed to origin. Clean working tree.

**Next:** Maintenance mode. `/improve` audit due 2026-06-22. PLAN.md Goal section still has stale margin figures (cosmetic). DEDUCTIONS and DISPUTE_DATA constants in generate_json.py were updated by a linter mid-session — verify the new values are correct if figures look off.

---

## 2026-06-20 20:30 — Redesign build complete (session wrap)

**Started from:** Redesign sections 1–4 committed. Section 5 charts built but uncommitted.

**Did:**
- Committed §5 (RevenueChart, MarginEvolutionChart, OverheadScatterChart — 3 D3 chart components)
- Built and committed §6 (capital-allocation dark callout cards — 3 data-driven #1a1a1a cards with full-range metrics)
- Built and committed §7 (sortable per-channel table — click-to-sort columns, segment color dots)
- Verified §8 (data fidelity — client-side math reconciles to pipeline: Walmart 47.9%, DTC 82.6%, UNFI 45.0%; COGS sourced as real dollars; generate_json.py confirmed)
- Completed §9 (build + deploy to Cloudflare Pages)
- Fixed chart width issue: removed maxWidth caps on 4 chart containers so charts fill the 1200px container
- Two deploys to Cloudflare Pages — both successful

**State:** All 9 redesign spec sections complete. Interactive drill-down tool live at channels.lailarallc.com with time filter, segment/channel waterfalls, 3 D3 charts, sortable table, and dark action cards. Clean working tree. 9 commits ahead of origin (unpushed).

**Next:** Push to origin. Remaining open item: document Astro frame pattern for reuse. Consider running /improve (due 2026-06-22). Otherwise project in maintenance mode — redesign arc complete.
